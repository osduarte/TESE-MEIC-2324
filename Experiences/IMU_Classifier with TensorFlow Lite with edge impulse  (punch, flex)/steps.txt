Seeed Studio XIAO nRF52840 Sense Edge Impulse Getting Started

1. Collect data directly to edge impulse - "xiao_ble_sense_accelerometer_rawdata"

2. Create and train a model in Edge Impuslse
Spectral Analysis - Great for analyzing repetitive motion, such as data from accelerometers. Extracts the frequency and power characteristics of a signal over time.
Classification - Learns patterns from data, and can apply these to new data. Great for categorizing movement or recognizing audio.

3. Upload the library, tensorflow lite and model to the microcontroller - "XIAOEI"
