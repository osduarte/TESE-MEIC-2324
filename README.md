# TESE-MEIC-2324

- Performing fitness exercises is not executed correctly can lead to injury. The scope of this project is
to incorporate an embedded system on a pair of weights (deadlifts) to monitor the correctness of the
exercise execution. The embedded system to be used is already available is able to acquire motion
(accelerometers) and communicate the sensor readings via bluetooth to a host. The host can be either
a mobile phone or a computer and is responsible for two taks: 1) control a point on screen with
the weight’s movement; 2) validate the movement via a Neural Network The work to be performed
consists of: - Extracting data from the sensor via bluetooth; - Dataset generation; - Selection and
training of the most suitable neural network; - Program an application to present different exercises
(challenges) to the user; - Keep tracking of the user’s performance (score); At the end of this project
it is expected to have a demonstration of the system, a written report (thesis) and a scientific paper
detailing on the developed work and its results
